Insulin and Glucagon Pump Simulation

## Simulation

Simulation screen of the Insulin/Glucagon pump will ask the user to enter the parameters for the simulation. Following parameters needs to set for running the simulation:
- **Blood Glucose Level** at start of the simulation
- **Max Dose** a patient can take in a day ( It varies according to patients situation)
- **Sensitivity Model** that defines the Glucose Sensitivity. It depends on patient's health. Most used sensitivity model are 1500, 1700, 1800
- **Total Days** for the simulation. Then simulation Graph will be presented for that days
- **Simulation Delay** that shows the live graph accordingly. If the delay is shorter, then graph will be presented with speed. Or to see the graph changes slowly, simulation delay should be set to lower value. 
- Then **food routine** needs to be set for the patient. That which food he/she takes in the breakfast, lunch and dinner. And what are total number of carbohydrates in the food for each time.

The resultant Graph will be as follow:
